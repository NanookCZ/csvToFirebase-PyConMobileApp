Anyone who tried implementing it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to remember and which tools are worth to check.

The talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable. 
I will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover technical problems we encountered:
* how to test that a service implements an API;
* how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;
* how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.

As theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help, describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to implement microservices integration tests @Growbots.",Szymon Matejczyk,"PhD student in network analysis and fan of...

In this talk, I'll try to convince you that using flexmock is better than using Python's built-in mock. I'll demonstrate how you can utilize flexmock to do all kinds of useful stuff in your testsuite, like mocking the famous 'requests' library or creating mocks that you can read aloud as a sentence and understood quickly. I'll also mention how to use flexmock for some advanced mocking techniques like spying or mocking chained method calls.",Slavek Kabrda,"I'm from a small town in Bohemian-Moravian highlands, where ""skiing"" means ""cross-country skiing"" and where foxes wish you good night.

Sure, it can be a blast to build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code, set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill. Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has baked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting and boring stuff
for you while allowing you to alter the test cases with arbitrary Python code.

There is still a lot of misunderstanding regarding GIL, coming from not-so-perfect documentation - not explaining the implications thoroughly and in a simple way; it's also often outdated.

Also, GIL's implementation changed a little in CPython 3.x that may affect programmers' choices.

This misinformation may, in some cases, drive them away from CPython where it's not really the worst choice. By providing comprehensive guide to today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop Python entirely.

There have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of which is Larry Hasting's project called GILectomy, which I hope to shed some light on.",Jacek Kołodziej,"Python backend developer at Growbots.

Na obou nástrojích je ale vidět jejich zastaralost. 

Místo ReSTu je daleko snažší používat Markdown a co se týče Sphinxu, tak psát pro něj rozšíření není zrovna procházka růžovým sadem. Jednodušší alternativou ke Sphinxu je MkDocs, jenže ten se zaměřuje jen na psanou prózu (mimo kódy) a chybí mu API generátor dokumentace. Tento problém by se dal vyřešit přes modul Pydoc, ale to není taky žádná sláva. 

Můj projekt, doksit, spojuje tyto dva přístupy: 
1. vytáhne dokumentační řetězce z kódu, sestaví z nich Markdown soubor a 
2. pokud existují k tomu i psané prózy (tutoriály aj.), vytvoří uvnitř repozitáře na GitHubu triviální ""readthedocs"" portál (do budoucna integrace s MkDocs).

In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole.

Some people have turned cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them.

This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.

I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:
 - What makes a problem seemingly impossible
 - How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard
 - How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity
 - Why Python might be a good hammer for that

MicroPython is a special version of Python, made to fit on devices small enough to fit in your hand and cheap enough to experiment with, without you worrying about damaging them.
With a couple of wires and electronic components, and a few lines of Python, you can turn motors, blink lights, measure temperatures or distances -- and eventually build all kinds of controllers, robots, toys, and other devices.
This workshop is a beginner-level introduction into the hardware world. We'll connect a microcontroller board to a computer and put on a colorful LED light show.

This workshop is for people with basic/intermediate knowledge of Python.",Sveťa Margetová,"Python programmer, data fan, meetup organizer, PyLadies couch and hobby mobile iOS developer",https://cz.pycon.org/2016/media/proposals/pyconcz2016/talks/13562101_1090392274329443_1054765655_n.jpg,@Mandragora258,SvetlanaM

This can be done for 2 hours or the whole day, both for beginners (copy&pasting strings to python files) or more advanced (validating command line inputs, streaming potentially large files, wrapping solutions into maintainable modules or classes, computing multiple outputs from 1 input, etc.).
It would be great if attendees already have Anaconda with Python 3 installed and IPython Notebook working.",Peter Hozak,"self-learned occasional pythonista, though mostly front end developer in MSD these days

In this workshop we will prove they are wrong. The plan is simple: set up Spark cluster in the cloud and run a few jobs on hundred-giga datasets.
Setting up Spark cluster with Hadoop File System is not an easy task if done from scratch. Google Cloud Platform enables one to set up a Hadoop cluster with Spark in a hassle-free manner. During the workshop we will show how to set everything up, make use of distributed processing tools provided by PySpark: RDDs and DataFrames to conclude with some fun exercises.
Apache Spark is a cluster computing engine that implements the MapReduce paradigm. We will quickly introduce it and go through its architecture.
In the first part of the training, we will see how to create and manage Spark cluster using Google Cloud Dataproc. We will focus on an environment for Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.
In the second part, you will see how easy it is to write MapReduce jobs to process gigabytes of data on tens of machines in parallel.
Each participant will need a Google Cloud account with some dollars to spent (it's possible to get a demo account with 200$) and Dataproc service enabled.

Geographical information systems (GIS) are computer systems that handle spatial (and temporal) data, helping us to analyze the data and understand their context, trying to predict future state.
In this workshop, we are going to go through the basics of GIS, spatial data representation (vector and raster), touching the topic of coordinate reference systems and introduce some basic concepts of GIS.
Python is the most geo-positive programming language nowadays, having bindings in most desktop, server programs, as well as core libraries - in this workshop, we are going to give brief introduction to Python geospatial programming and overview about possibilities how Python can be used together with various spatial tools.",Jachym Cepicky,"Open people's minds and open technologies for better geospatial world.
