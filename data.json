Sure, it can be a blast to build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code, set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill. Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has baked in first-class Python support.

Tato touha může být zmařena při nahlédnutí do učebnic programování, které poznatky budují systematicky a pro začátečníka mnohdy nepochopitelně.\nPřednáška ukazuje, jak lze začít tvořit a hrát si s jednoduchými grafickými objekty bez znalostí programování. Společně definujeme několik grafických objektů, které rozpohybujeme po grafickém plátně a jednoduchým zachycením událostí z klávesnice zabezpečíme možnost interaktivního ovládání hry.",

Každý jednou začínal a možnosti pomoci začít i dalším se díky PyLadies a naucse.python.cz velmi posunuly. Předvedu, jak lze jednoduchou aplikací již vytvořených materiálů a bohatého know-how organizátorů různých měst učit Python zase další lidi. Jaký přínos z toho koučové mají a co to přináší celé komunitě a hlavně začátečníkům. Nastíním základní know-how v několika bodech a znázorním, proč není vůbec životně důležité nejprve 3 roky programovat Fibonacciho a faktorial!, ale je lepší zajistit dostatek reálných projektů. Ukážu, co jsem zvládla za jeden rok (jakožto bývalá PyLady, která si procesem prošla a nyní programuje v MSD IT), kam obvykle směřují mé otázky a co mě jako začátečníka naopak vůbec neláká a neposouvá v práci dál.",

S pythonisty se poprvé střetla v roce 2015 na DjangoGirls a dál se učila hadí jazyk na intenzivním kurzu PyLadies v Praze.

Jednodušší alternativou ke Sphinxu je MkDocs, jenže ten se zaměřuje jen na psanou prózu (mimo kódy) a chybí mu API generátor dokumentace. Tento problém by se dal vyřešit přes modul Pydoc, ale to není taky žádná sláva. \n\nMůj projekt, doksit, spojuje tyto dva přístupy: \n1. vytáhne dokumentační řetězce z kódu, sestaví z nich Markdown soubor a \n2. pokud existují k tomu i psané prózy (tutoriály aj.), vytvoří uvnitř repozitáře na GitHubu triviální \"readthedocs\" portál (do budoucna integrace s MkDocs). \n\nNa přednášce představím existujících knihovny a jejich problémy, ukážu, co vše zatím doksit umí, jak ho použít a kam bude směřovat jeho další vývoj, do kterého se můžeš zapojit i ty.",

TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem. This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.\n\nI will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:\n - What makes a problem seemingly impossible\n - How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard\n - How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity\n - Why Python might be a good hammer for that\n\nFollow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the final design (puzzle #4 \"the Dice\", TMOU 17 http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?",

But can it leave the computer world and do something \"real\"?\nMicroPython is a special version of Python, made to fit on devices small enough to fit in your hand and cheap enough to experiment with, without you worrying about damaging them.\nWith a couple of wires and electronic components, and a few lines of Python, you can turn motors, blink lights, measure temperatures or distances -- and eventually build all kinds of controllers, robots, toys, and other devices.\nThis workshop is a beginner-level introduction into the hardware world. We'll connect a microcontroller board to a computer and put on a colorful LED light show.\nIf you know variables and if/for/while statements, you know enough Python to participate.\nYou will need a computer with administrator access (to install the necessary drivers).",

The plan is simple: set up Spark cluster in the cloud and run a few jobs on hundred-giga datasets.\nSetting up Spark cluster with Hadoop File System is not an easy task if done from scratch. Google Cloud Platform enables one to set up a Hadoop cluster with Spark in a hassle-free manner. During the workshop we will show how to set everything up, make use of distributed processing tools provided by PySpark: RDDs and DataFrames to conclude with some fun exercises.\nApache Spark is a cluster computing engine that implements the MapReduce paradigm. We will quickly introduce it and go through its architecture.\nIn the first part of the training, we will see how to create and manage Spark cluster using Google Cloud Dataproc. We will focus on an environment for Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.\nIn the second part, you will see how easy it is to write MapReduce jobs to process gigabytes of data on tens of machines in parallel.\nEach participant will need a Google Cloud account with some dollars to spent (it's possible to get a demo account with 200$) and Dataproc service enabled. Laptop with Internet connection is a must too.",

Anyone who tried implementing it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to remember and which tools are worth to check.\n\nThe talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable. \nI will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover technical problems we encountered:\n* how to test that a service implements an API;\n* how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;\n* how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.\n\nAs theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help, describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to implement microservices integration tests @Growbots.",

I'll demonstrate how you can utilize flexmock to do all kinds of useful stuff in your testsuite, like mocking the famous 'requests' library or creating mocks that you can read aloud as a sentence and understood quickly.

By providing comprehensive guide to today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop Python entirely.\n\nThere have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of which is Larry Hasting's project called GILectomy, which I hope to shed some light on.",

In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and the insights we have generated from them.",

            "description": "Horetu (https://pythonhosted.org/horetu) exposes Python functions as command-line interfaces, web interfaces, and configuration files. In addition to being a very practical tool, horetu is interesting because its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function objects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and detailed documentation from functions that were written with no intent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear demonstration of the merits of following conventions.",

            "description": "In 2012 not a lot of people were interested in Python in the relatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer girls were interested in Python. During our talk we will share the story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started the community in a small country like Albania and what other small cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in developing a Python community in similar conditions.\nMost important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls and the steps we should take to fix it.",

            "description": "Agile software development used to be really cool back in the 00's. The vision of old school waterfall projects, with months of work before integrating and releasing software to users gives me the creeps. But let's return to the present. I can hardly even recall working in a non-agile project. I feel that most of the Agile manifesto principles are in my DNA more than a thing to follow. If you want to keep growing in this industry you might want to start building on top of that. This presentation contains my experience about aligning people, sharing a direction, and how servant leadership works.",
