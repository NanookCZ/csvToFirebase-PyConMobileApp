As a data scientist you can choose the right answer for many questions in various industries. Python is one of the most used programming languages in data science which supports many libraries that make your job easier so you can focus on your data.\nIn this workshop, we are going to extract meaning from a larger data set, perform data mining, design test data set, create visualization using matplotlib, apply recommendations of a products and learn best practices in cleaning and preparing your data.\n\nWe will be using iPython Notebook, Python 3 version. This workshop is for people with basic/intermediate knowledge of Python.",

The plan is simple: set up Spark cluster in the cloud and run a few jobs on hundred-giga datasets.\nSetting up Spark cluster with Hadoop File System is not an easy task if done from scratch. Google Cloud Platform enables one to set up a Hadoop cluster with Spark in a hassle-free manner. During the workshop we will show how to set everything up, make use of distributed processing tools provided by PySpark: RDDs and DataFrames to conclude with some fun exercises.\nApache Spark is a cluster computing engine that implements the MapReduce paradigm. We will quickly introduce it and go through its architecture.\nIn the first part of the training, we will see how to create and manage Spark cluster using Google Cloud Dataproc. We will focus on an environment for Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.\nIn the second part, you will see how easy it is to write MapReduce jobs to process gigabytes of data on tens of machines in parallel.\nEach participant will need a Google Cloud account with some dollars to spent (it's possible to get a demo account with 200$) and Dataproc service enabled. Laptop with Internet connection is a must too.",

Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has baked in first-class Python support.

And with frequent releases, manual testing is exhausting.\nTherefore developers need integration and system tests, aside from basic unit tests - to make sure their commits are integrated properly and did not break anything. No more: one hotfix creates two new bugs!\n\nFor beginners: I will give a brief introduction to software testing and its types and talk about how easy is to start with writing automatic tests in Python.\n\nFor advanced: I will present integration testing of Cleerio web mapping application (originally written in JavaScript and PHP) using Python together with Selenium project.",

TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem. This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.\n\nI will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:\n - What makes a problem seemingly impossible\n - How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard\n - How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity\n - Why Python might be a good hammer for that\n\nFollow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the final design (puzzle #4 \"the Dice\", TMOU 17 http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?",

Amongst other things we at CommOps are trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and the insights we have generated from them.",

Also nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls and the steps we should take to fix it.",
